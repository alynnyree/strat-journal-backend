# Strat Trading Journal — Project Context

## Who you're working with

The owner is a discretionary options trader, **not a developer**. Assume no
coding background. Explain things in plain language and avoid jargon unless
you define it. He does not want to read code to understand what changed —
tell him what it does and what to check.

He primarily uses the app on an **iPhone in Safari**. He has a MacBook Pro
(16-inch 2019, Intel i7, 16GB, macOS Tahoe) available for development, but
the app itself is used on the phone. Anything that only works on desktop is
not a fix.

## Working rules (these matter — they came from real failures)

1. **Verify before reporting.** Do not say something works until you have
   actually checked it. Run the code, run tests, check syntax. "It should
   work" is not acceptable. If you cannot verify something (visual
   appearance on a phone, real Schwab data), say so explicitly.

2. **Full review over one-at-a-time patching.** When debugging, read all
   relevant code first and report every problem found together. Do not
   fix one error, ship it, wait for a bug report, fix the next. That
   pattern has burned a lot of time on this project.

3. **Change one thing at a time when the cause is unclear.** Several
   past sessions shipped multiple simultaneous changes and made it
   impossible to tell which one broke things.

4. **Diagnose from evidence, not inference.** Browser console output and
   actual data beat guessing from screenshots. Ask for real error output
   before theorising.

5. **Say when you're wrong.** If a previous fix was aimed at the wrong
   cause, name that plainly rather than quietly moving on.

## Architecture

**Frontend** — repo `alynnyree/strat-journal-app`, hosted on GitHub Pages at
`https://alynnyree.github.io/strat-journal-app/` (note the repo name in the
path; the bare domain 404s). A single `index.html`: vanilla JS, no build
step, no framework, dark theme, PWA-installable. Trades are stored in the
browser's localStorage under `strat_trades`.

**Backend** — repo `alynnyree/strat-journal-backend`, hosted on Render at
`strat-journal-backend.onrender.com`. Node/Express with Upstash Redis for
storage.

Backend files and what they do:
- `server.js` — Express app entry
- `auth.js` — Schwab OAuth, token refresh
- `api.js` — trade/pending/backfill/enrich routes
- `cron.js` — 5-minute auto-sync, historical backfill, runs all enrichment
- `schwabClient.js` — Schwab API calls
- `schwabStreamer.js` — persistent WebSocket to Schwab's real-time streamer
  (ACCT_ACTIVITY), auto-reconnect with backoff, rotates every 25 min before
  token expiry
- `matcher.js` — pairs opening/closing option fills into completed trades
- `tokenStore.js` / `tradeStore.js` — Redis persistence
- `ftfcCheck.js` — Full Time Frame Continuity across 13 timeframes,
  underlying price lookup, shared `fetchCandles`
- `replayData.js` — pulls the 1-minute candle window for Bar Replay
- `media.js` — screenshot upload/pending/delete (multipart, multer)
- `aiClient.js` / `aiRoutes.js` — Gemini API calls, `/ai/analyze` route

**Environment variables on Render:** `SCHWAB_CLIENT_ID`, `SCHWAB_SECRET`,
`SCHWAB_REDIRECT_URI`, `FRONTEND_ORIGIN`, `APP_SECRET`, `SYNC_CRON`,
`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`,
`PUSHCUT_NOTIFICATION_NAME`, `PUSHCUT_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

AI features use **Google Gemini's free tier** (gemini-2.5-flash, schema-
enforced JSON), not Anthropic's API — chosen to avoid ongoing API cost.
Browsers cannot call these APIs directly (CORS), so all AI calls are
server-side.

## The trading methodology (needed to reason about features correctly)

Uses **The Strat**. Key concepts the code implements:

- **FTFC (Full Time Frame Continuity)** — timeframes aligned in the same
  direction. Implemented across 13 timeframes (6M, 3M, 1M, 1W, 1D, 4H, 2H,
  1H, 30m, 15m, 5m, 3m, 1m). Confirmed when **any 4+ consecutive**
  timeframes agree — the run can start anywhere in the sequence, not just
  at the largest timeframe.
- **Setups traded:** 2→3 Reversal, FTFC Continuation, Broadening Formation
  Reversal.
- **Instruments:** SPY and IWM options, 0DTE–3DTE. Occasionally others.
- **Always buys to open** (calls or puts), never sells to open. This is why
  P&L needs no sign flip: a rising option price is always profit,
  regardless of whether the underlying bet is Long or Short. Long/Short is
  derived from CALL vs PUT, not from buy/sell instruction.
- **Stops** are drawn on the **underlying's chart** (a price level on
  SPY/IWM), not on the option premium. Realized R:R is therefore computed
  from the underlying's move, not the option's:
  `(undExit − undEntry) / |undEntry − stop|`, sign-flipped for Short.

## Feature status

**Working:**
- Schwab OAuth and auto-sync of trades directly into the Journal
- Real-time Schwab streaming (verified live)
- FTFC calculation, underlying price at entry/exit
- Bar Replay (candle-by-candle playback via TradingView Lightweight Charts)
- Realized R:R calculation
- AI Analyst (server-side, Gemini)
- PWA install

**Not working / not built:**
- **Screenshot capture pipeline** — Pushcut → iOS Shortcut → backend →
  auto-attach by timestamp. Owner confirmed this is NOT complete. Note it
  is inherently one-tap-per-trade, not zero-tap.
- **AI strategy auto-classification** — owner confirmed NOT actually built.
- **Backtesting** — never started.
- **Native iOS app** for zero-tap session recording — fully scoped, not
  started. Needs Xcode + free Apple ID (Personal Team signing avoids the
  $99/yr fee but requires re-signing roughly every 7 days). Design: one tap
  to start a session via Control Center tile, one-time ReplayKit consent,
  records through multiple trades, backend auto-clips each trade from the
  session recording using the same timestamp-matching approach as
  screenshots.

## Known traps (hard-won — do not re-learn these)

- **Lightweight Charts positions by candle SLOT, not by real time.** Adding
  a drawing as a data series with a far-future timestamp does NOT stretch
  it across the chart — it collapses into one slot, and inserting a
  non-candle timestamp physically shifts every candle. User-drawn lines are
  therefore painted on a **separate transparent canvas overlaid on the
  chart**, never added as chart series.
- **Forcing `barSpacing`/`minBarSpacing` while removing `fitContent()`
  blanked the chart entirely** (no candles, no gridlines, no price scale,
  and no console error). Candle size is fixed by limiting how much data is
  loaded, not by fighting the chart's layout.
- **Schwab retains 1-minute candle data for only ~30–35 days.** Older
  trades legitimately have no replay data. `ftfcCheck.js` cascades
  1m → 5m → 30m → daily so older trades still get an underlying price.
- **Expired options never produce a closing fill.** Their open legs used to
  sit in the matcher forever, so re-trading the same contract weeks later
  paired the new close against the ancient open — producing "trades"
  spanning a month and replays with thousands of candles. `matcher.js` now
  purges dead legs and prefers same-day matches.
- **iOS Safari measures container size before a fullscreen modal finishes
  laying out.** Chart sizing needs a short delayed re-measure.
- **The `/media` and `/ai` routes require the app key.** The frontend has an
  "App Key" field on the Journal tab that must match the backend's
  `APP_SECRET`. A 403 on `/media/pending` means these don't match.

## Testing expectations

There is no test suite. Before claiming a change works:
- Run a real JavaScript syntax check on `index.html`'s script block
  (extract it and parse it — brace counting is not sufficient).
- For backend logic changes (matching, date/window math), write a throwaway
  Node script that exercises the actual edge cases and print the results.
  Past bugs would have been caught this way.
- State plainly what you could NOT verify — anything about how the app
  looks or behaves on a physical iPhone is unverifiable from here.

## Deployment

Both repos deploy on commit to `main`:
- Frontend → GitHub Pages (takes a minute or two; verify via the Actions
  tab, not the Settings→Pages "last deployed" text, which caches badly)
- Backend → Render (auto-redeploys)

After backend matching/enrichment changes, the owner needs to tap
**"Reset & Re-import Trades"** on the Journal tab to rebuild existing
trades — old trades keep their stale data otherwise.
